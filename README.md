# Recipes without the novel

We like to cook sometimes, but sometimes it takes 3 minutes for a page to load because its so jammed with useless ads and hi-rez barely related images. So what if we just extracted the actual recipes from all the noise?

# ro_main_e

Starting with a beautiful soup python script to extract the exact elements we need, we are creating an output csv of all exisiting recipes on all recipes. The script, at the time of writing, takes about 6 hours to run.

While it runs perfectly fine as is, occasionally we've had the website yell at us for scraping, thus the header and checkpoints.

Build a dummy website to present this information in a searchable manner.
